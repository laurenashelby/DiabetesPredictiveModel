# DiabetesPredictiveModel
Using a dataset collected from patients in the Pima Indians community to use various health statistics (i.e. blood pressure, insulin levels) to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes. I use both randomForest and support vector machine learning models to build accurate predictive models for diabetes likelihood among this population.
